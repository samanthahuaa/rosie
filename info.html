    <p>In the 1950s, the scientific community was racing to figure out the structure of DNA. Many scientists wanted to discover it first, it was simply a question of who would. Discovering the structure of DNA was a result of piecing together many discoveries along the way. One of the major discoveries was Photo 51, an impeccable X-ray diffraction image produced by Rosalind Franklin. Photo 51 was the result of meticulous lab work as the technology at the time was not advanced enough to significantly aid Franklin’s work. This photo has a distinctive X shape which revealed that DNA had a double helix structure. This was groundbreaking because it narrowed the scope of the possible structures and all that was left to figure out was the arrangement of bases.</p>

    <p>It was common practice in the scientific community to share findings through published articles. However, because Franklin was receiving funds from Cambridge she had to report her unpublished findings to the university. All of the unpublished findings Cambridge received were accumulated into a report from the Medical Research Council. Watson and Crick were rival scientists of Franklin and continually mocked her because she was female in a predominately male field. Watson and Crick referred to her as “Rosie” and other nicknames that were meant to undermine her. However, they knew that they could not match her wit. So when they found a report from the Medical Research Council which contained Franklin’s Photo 51, they kept it. Upon closer inspection of the photo, they found that it provided more information than simply the structure of DNA. Using this new information, they were able to discover the entire structure of DNA. Ultimately, their findings were based on Franklin’s research however when Watson recounted his journey to this discovery, he only very briefly mentioned Franklin’s impact on his work. This complete disregard for her work has left its print on history as Watson and Crick received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine while Franklin received no credit for her impactful work.</p>
